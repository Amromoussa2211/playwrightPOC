/**
 * ðŸ§© Function Name: countDuplicateCharacters
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Description:
 * This function prompts the user to enter a string,
 * then counts how many characters are duplicated within that string.
 * It ignores spaces and is case-insensitive (e.g. "A" and "a" are treated the same).
 *
 * Function Steps:
 * 1. Ask the user for input using `prompt()`.
 * 2. Convert the string to lowercase for consistent comparison.
 * 3. Loop through each character and count how many times it appears.
 * 4. Identify characters that appear more than once (duplicates).
 * 5. Log each duplicate and the number of times it appears.
 * 6. Finally, log how many unique characters were duplicated.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:  "Hello World"
 * Output:
 *   'l' appears 3 times
 *   'o' appears 2 times
 *   Total number of duplicated characters: 2
